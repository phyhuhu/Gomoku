# Gomoku Game

Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game.
Two players alternate turns placing a piece of their color on an empty cell. 
The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner. 
The default board size is 6X6, which can be changed through "Set Up Board Size".
