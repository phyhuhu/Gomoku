  <h3>Instruction:</h3>
  <p>
    Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game.
    Two players alternate turns placing a piece of their color on an empty cell. 
    The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner. 
    The default board size is 10X10, which can be changed through "Set Up Board Size".
